# VegansBlog
An attempt is made to familairize myself with PHP by creating a simple blog with it. The basic features of the blog are as follows:

 :snowflake: Creating users and storing their information in tables using the procedural method of interaction, that is, mysqli.
 
 :snowflake: Logging in and out
 
 :snowflake: Writing recipes
 
 :snowflake: Editing, deleting, viewing recipes
